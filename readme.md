## Spectral Tester

Two goals to this project.
1. Identify which part of an OpenAPI spec will be targeted by a spectral rule
2. Validate the rule to determine a pass/fail.

### UI
Three boxes: 1 for the spectral rule, 1 for the OpenAPI spec, 1 for the output
The UI should update automatically, e.g. no submissions, mostly client side.

### Service classes
